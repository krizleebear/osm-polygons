# osm-polygons

## City outline polygons
OpenStreetMap offers geo data in raw data form. For building services you usually have to preprocess the data.
This project takes OSM's raw data, extracts all administrative boundaries and converts them as polygons.

The polygons offered by this project can e.g. be used to draw the outlines of your city.
Or perform reverse geocoding: Take a point on a map and resolve its administrative membership: City, County, State and City.
